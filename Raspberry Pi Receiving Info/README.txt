Decipher.py was supposed to decipher the limted string that could be sent via the micro:bit's radio. It worked, however, we could not get it to function with the micro:bit's motors.

The radio folder contains the send and recieve functions that allowed the micro:bit to send one signal to another, and that other micro:bit would receive it with the code.
