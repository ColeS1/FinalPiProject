Buttons.py is what is used to program how the keys will be used for manipulating the GUI.

CONSTANTS.py is what was used to help with the GUI.

SenderRadio.py was used so that we could flash the program that we "built" on to the microbit to then send over to the idling micro:bit.

SerialMonitor.py was used so that the RPi 400 could continously read what is on the serial monitor (which is receiving from the arduino).

The GUI.py is the bulk of the project, it displays all of the information that is going on in regards to what block was placed on the rack, arguments given, and what line this is occurring on. It also has commands for text to speech to tell the visually impaired what is going on.
